8 CHIP VIRTUAL MACHINE
BY: AMIT PINCHASI

hi! thats my virtual machine of 8chip!
i built this project for my final project for school!
i implemnted sound, timing, stack, registers, memory, screen and opcode like the original 8chip.
i used SDL for make it acually runabble in windows and used the windows api for some functions.
here is a link with the docs which i followed when building the chip:
